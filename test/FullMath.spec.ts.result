    - check a bunch of random inputs against JS implementation
    #mulDiv
      ✔ reverts if denominator is 0 (4082ms)
      ✔ reverts if denominator is 0 and numerator overflows
      ✔ reverts if output overflows uint256
      ✔ reverts if output overflows uint256
      ✔ reverts on overflow with all max inputs
      ✔ all max inputs
      ✔ accurate without phantom overflow
      ✔ accurate with phantom overflow
      ✔ accurate with phantom overflow and repeating decimal
