    #tickSpacingToMaxLiquidityPerTick
      ✔ returns the correct value for low fee
      ✔ returns the correct value for medium fee
      ✔ returns the correct value for high fee
      ✔ returns the correct value for entire range
      ✔ returns the correct value for 2302
    #getFeeGrowthInside
      ✔ returns all for two uninitialized ticks if tick is inside
      ✔ returns 0 for two uninitialized ticks if tick is above
      ✔ returns 0 for two uninitialized ticks if tick is below
      ✔ subtracts upper tick if below
      ✔ subtracts lower tick if above
      ✔ subtracts upper and lower tick if inside
      ✔ works correctly with overflow on inside tick
    #update
      ✔ flips from zero to nonzero
      ✔ does not flip from nonzero to greater nonzero
      ✔ flips from nonzero to zero
      ✔ does not flip from nonzero to lesser nonzero
      ✔ does not flip from nonzero to lesser nonzero
      ✔ reverts if total liquidity gross is greater than max
      ✔ nets the liquidity based on upper flag
      ✔ reverts on overflow liquidity gross
      ✔ assumes all growth happens below ticks lte current tick
      ✔ does not set any growth fields if tick is already initialized
      ✔ does not set any growth fields for ticks gt current tick
    #clear
      ✔ deletes all the data in the tick
    #cross
      ✔ flips the growth variables
      ✔ two flips are no op
